                    <b> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b> (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace
                    scientist and
                    statesman who
                    served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and
                    aerospace
                    engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                    Development
                    Organisation
                    (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military
                    missile
                    development
                    efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch
                    vehicle
                    technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
                    1998,
                    the
                    first
                    since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]
